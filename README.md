This is the repository for our work on the PAC-MAN project.

To play the game, extract the .exe file, the "Sounds" folder and the "sprites" from the .zip archive.
Download the music files below and place it in the "Sounds" folder.
Run the .exe in the same folder as the two folders from the .zip.

You can find music files required to play the pacman game on : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vAfjkoQY26vbqMUDis2KcLu5SAT9WdSQ?usp=sharing.

- classes and structures in camelCase with caps at the begining of each word --> MyClass
- constants in all Caps and underscores between words --> CONSTANTE, LARGEUR_ECRAN
